**Loan Prediction Analysis** 

**Overview** 
This project aims to predict if a customer will be provided with a loan using the Decision Tree and XGBoost model. This project is done as a part of Kaggle Playground series 
The dataset used for this analysis is included in the repository. 
The project follows a structured approach to building a loan status prediction model.

**The stages include:** 
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the dataset's structure, distribution of features, and identifying patterns. 
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies in the data.
3. **Data Transformation:** Transforming categorical variables and preparing the data for modeling.
4. **Model Building and Evaluation:** Developing a Decision Tree and XGBoost model to predict loan status and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.
