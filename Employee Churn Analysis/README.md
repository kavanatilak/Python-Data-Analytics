**Employee Churn Analysis**
**Project Overview**
This project aims to predict employee churn using logistic regression. The dataset used for this analysis is included in the repository.

The project follows a structured approach to building an employee churn prediction model. 

**The stages include:**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the dataset's structure, distribution of features, and identifying patterns.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies in the data.
- **Data Transformation:** Transforming categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and preparing the data for modeling.
- **Model Building and Evaluation:** Developing a logistic regression model to predict employee churn and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.
